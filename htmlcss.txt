Introduction to HTML and CSS
    HTML- raw data that a webpage is built out of (text, links, cards, lists, buttons)
    CSS- style to the plain elements
    HTML puts info on a webpage and CSS positions that info, gives it color, font, etc
    They aren't really programming languages becasue tehy present information, they don't program logic 

HTML=structure of website
CSS=makes it visually appealing
JavaScript=robust programming language that changes components to match specs

common web dev languages are HTML CSS JavaScript PHP Python Ruby and SQL
Ruby and PHP are popular among startups and web developers, entrepreneurs
Primary languages of HTML CSS and JavaScript
Ruby is scalable and fast
With SQL you can maintain a large database in a streamlined manner
the language you use depends on your specific project and business goals


HTML- hyper text markup language simplistic yet powerful
HTML is a good place to start if you've never programmed before
HTML markups are enhanced by CSS and javascript 

CSS= a static programming language style sheet language thats amost entirely focused on improving the presentation
CSS is used to create static visual effects


Elements and tags

opening tags tell the browser that this is the start of an HTML element
comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <>
paragraph = <p>
closing tags have a slash </p>
<p>some text content</p>

HTML has a vast list of predefined tags that you can use to create all kinds of elements

void elements- elements that don't have a closing tag
<br>
<img>

three parts- opening tag, text content, closing tag

always have to have an opening and closing tag
opening paragraph <p>...</p>

there are hundreds of elements so no use in learning them all at once
theres a subset that are recurring that we will remember quickly
h1 is heading


HTML Boilerplate

all html docs have the same basic structure or boilerplate that needs to be in place before anything useful can be done
basic boilerplate
how to open HTML docs in browser

every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration
Doctype for the latest HTML version is 
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> lang="en">
</html>

lang represents an HTML attribute associated with the given HTML tag
lang specifies language of the text content in that element
used to imporve accessibility of the webpage and allows assistive tech to adapt according to the language and invoke correct pronunciation

<head> element is where wer put important meta info about our webpages
required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser
inside the head we should not use any elemenet that displays content on the webpage
<head> goes within <html> and should always be the first thing under <html>

we should always have the <meta> tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element

<title>
gives a title- should always have a title
otherwise defaults to file name
which is not meaningful for users

Body element
last element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is Body
this is where all content displayed to users will go
<body>

Viewing HTML in the browser: several options
you can click and drag
you can find in your file system and double click
you can use terminal to open file in browser
cd to directory then open ./name.html

Typing an ! will auto fill the boilerplate

What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?
to tell the browser what version of html to use to render the doc

what is the html element?
its the root- everything else is a descendeant of it

purpose of head element?
gives info that is not user facing
meta information about our webpages- info for them to render correctly
should not use any element that displays content on the page
meta element, title element

body
info that is user facing
all the content displayed to users will go there
text, images, lists, links, so on



Working with text - more elements

<p> is for paragraphs so that you can separate text

<h1> <h2> etc are for headings </h2>

<strong> </strong> makes text bold

<em> </em> makes text italic

Nesting:
<body>
    <p> bla bla bla 
</p>
    <p> bla bla bla. </p>
</body>

the p is nested under the parent body and the two paragraphs are siblings

HTML comments- not visible to browser
<!-- to make a comment in HTML surround it like this -->

shortcut: cmd + /
