    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About the Odin Project</a>
    <!-- href attribute is needed for links
     you can link anything in this way
     the default is opening a link in a current tab (_self)-->
     <p>
     <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target= "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
     <!-- href= specifies destination link
        target= specifies where it will be opened (default _self), new tab or window- _blank
        
        rel attribute= describes relation between current page and linked document
        
        noopener means link opened in new tab/window cant interact with or access original page
        without it, new page cna use javascript to manipulate original page which is security risk
        
        no referrer= privacy and security, prevents new page from knowing where user came from and includes behavior of noopener
        
        noopener prevents phishing
        noreferrer prevents telling the opened link that your webpage links to it
        -->

    <!-- an absolute link is a link to another website on the internet:
        made of scheme://domain/path
        a relative link is a link to a page within our own website:
        do not include domain name since it is on the same site; only have the file path to the other page relative to the page you are creating it on
        -->
    <p>
    <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
    <!-- you can use about.html alone if they're in the same directory
        if they're not, you need the directory name so pages/about.html
        if any problems putting ./ before the link should fix it bc tells it to look for the file/directory relative to the current directory-->
